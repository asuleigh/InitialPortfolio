ABSTRACT: This my first personal portfolio website. I have created this site in hopes that I will be able to continuously use it to improve my skills and for a place to showcase my public profile and work. (Aside: The current version is created to visually reflect the first assignment. There are more styles that I have coded that I will reintegrate in the future)

i: INSTALLATION
-In order to clone or download website for functionality on local drives, be sure to install files to proper locations.

-index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html should be located in the source folder. The source folder should also contain an "Assets" folder.

-Inside of the "Assets" folder, make sure there is a "css" and an "images" folder

-Clone or download style.css to the "css" folder and and images available to the "images' folder

ii: USAGE
-Layout is as it appears. The index page contains my About Me, the portfolio page contains links to past work, and the contact page gives users a form to contact me. Links in Header work and so does the Submit button. Currently messages will not redirect, though you can interact with the box. More will be added/finished in coming updates.
